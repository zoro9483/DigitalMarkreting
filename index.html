                        <strong>Hello!</strong><br>

                        
                        I'm a React developer interested in Digital marketing, My experience started with learning photography 
                        then human recourses, starring learning about WordPress and then learning about SEO, after that I self-taught myself about
                        INbound marketing, then I attend many conferences with the ministry of youth there where I learn about Design thinking
                        to build a project that helps the community and generate money.

                        I've experienced with Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, After Effects, google analytics, and learning about copywriting too.                          
                       

                        <p class="second">
                        I scour blogs, forums, hastags and use tools like
                        <strong><li>Google trends</li></strong>
                        <strong><li>Google keyword tool</li></strong>
                        <strong><li>Facebook’s Audience insights tools</li></strong>
                        to find relevant and popular keywords for SEO purposes and to find out audience behavior and interests.</p>
                        
                        
                        
                        I’ve helped a friend from Germany to reach her target customers in pinterest by joining other groups and sharing her post to other pins,
                        it was interesting and diferent from Facebook marketing. 
                      
                        <p>I’m believing that marketing is not only by creating ads only on social media or good pictures and good design logo, it's more about what value 
                          we are delivering to the customers and the strategy that knows and feel what the customer need and creat need for our service or product even if the 
                          customer didn't know that he has a problem without our service or product.
                        
            </div>
            <div class="last">
            <strong><p>also, I've learned about building a Facebook chat bot for my friend business page running in Sudan</p></strong>
            </div>

            <div class="credentials">I'm also a expereince in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I learn building landing pages in React js, build sites in Wordpress. and google site</div>

            <div class="thanks">
            <p class="thanks">Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you!</p></div>
